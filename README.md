# Home Work: 02
# Title: Single Activity with a spinner, Button, and TextView
# Platform: Android
# IDE: Android Studio
# Language: Java,XML
# This design is created by using constraint layout using a Spinner for list, a Button for check and finally display for a TextView in XML.
# And in the main activity class I've added generic arraylist for animal. Then I've given the list on spinner. Using the button I am checking the selected value and finally the id and value displayed on textview.
